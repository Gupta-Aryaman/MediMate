# Virtual Health Assistant for Prescribing Medications and Treatment Plans

This README provides instructions for data preparation for the Virtual Health Assistant project. To use the dataset required for this project, follow these steps:

## Data Preparation

To start data preparation, first download the dataset from [Figshare](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/DDXPlus_Dataset/20043374).

1. Create a `dataset` folder inside the `model` directory.
2. Copy both the JSON files and `release_train_patients.csv` from your downloaded dataset into the `dataset` folder.
3. Rename `release_train_patients.csv` to `training.csv`.
4. Rename `release_conditions.json` to `diagnosis_keywords.csv`.
5. Rename `release_evidences.json` to `question_keywords.csv`.

Your data is now ready for use in the Virtual Health Assistant project.

## Important Notes

- Make sure that the dataset folder and file names match the provided instructions exactly for the project to work as expected.
